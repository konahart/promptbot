Observe how people do the same simple things in many different ways. Put them into words. Each person has a way of drinking water, sitting on a chair, walking, etc. Try to describe them, paying attention to how their characteristic way of doing things reflects their personality. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/68084006594) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
You don’t have to write in chronological order. Write in the order you feel inspired to write.

Share your work and ask for opinions. To improve, it’s important to have people with different points of view giving you opinion on your writing.

You have infinite possibilities in your mind and hands. What can you do with it? Your brain is capable of creating anything, so create the impossible: new technology, creatures, describe a new color, make up stories of things that no one thought could happen and make it believable or silly.

First drafts are made to be awful, so write without fear. Ask any writer: the first draft of a novel is not made to be good. It’s just to put your ideas down. You will have to edit one or two (maybe three) times until you have your masterpiece. Don’t be afraid of writing it. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/65910777578) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
If there’s something stopping you, but you don’t know exactly what it is, change everything. Start writing something new. Go write in a different place in your house or outside the house.

When something inspires you it’s important to adapt it and reshape it to fit your own context. Do not blatantly ‘copy and paste.’ It’s called stealing like an artist, and harsh as that term sounds, we all do it. You wanted to include orcs in your story because many other fantasy novels have orcs? Well, if you’re not reworking them, renewing them, you’re not stealing like an artist. You’ve got to re-invent them, make them new and exciting again. And so help me do not make orcs some innately ‘evil’ race that is ‘subtly’ representing PoC. It’s only become more and more blindingly offensive through time. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/65454224225) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Take advantage of games such as The Elder Scrolls : Skyrim or Dragon Age, where you are offered a platform to develop your character in ways you may not have thought to. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/65268009760) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Print your writing on fanciful paper. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/65059719279) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Write on small and ugly paper. This tricks your brain into believing that you don’t have to write anything perfect.

Write all the time, wherever and whenever you can. Write in the bus, between classes, during breaks, when your boss is not looking. Go to sleep 15 minutes later and use those 15 minutes to write. There’s plenty of time to write in your day, and if you think there isn’t, you are not looking hard enough. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/64880316656) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)

Make a list containing five to ten pieces of writing advice. Now follow them. The list of writing advice your favorite author has wrote probably looks like a very good list. However, the list contains what works for them. Make a list of what works for you, and follow your own advice. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/64597412530) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Make goals, but small and achievable ones. If your goal is to write five thousand words a day, chances are you will not feel motivated to start, and may not be able to finish. If your goal is to write 500 words a day, it won’t be difficult to reach that, so it will be easier to start and to go beyond that word count every day. You can and should make big long-term goals, but the daily ones are better if kept smaller. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/64495482755) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Finish what you’re writing. Anyone can start writing a story, but to be a good writer you have to finish it. Even if it’s not as good as you wanted it to be, finish it and move on to the next. Don’t let your incomplete works pile up. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/64402633388) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Don’t try to please others. Write about what comes naturally to you.

Try to keep a list of words you feel you’re using too often. Come the end of the first draft, find all these nasty little words and work to get rid of them.

When you reach a point where you have no idea what to do, where to go, leave a specific code. This code should not occur anywhere else in the work, be it numbers or a shorthand. At the end, simply find this code to revisit the narrative gaps. A number sequence or a code like BrBaSobs or even s2gSoA work well. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/63481232639) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
When you stop to drink, stop to think, stop to even take a breath, you need to save. Save like the dickens. That’s what really rescues a work. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/63388321019) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)

Take in mind what people tell you to fix. Ignore when people tell you exactly how to fix. (Please do not follow this advice in areas like architecture and law.

Music can occupy a part of your thought that could be better spent focusing on the writing. Turn your music off occasionally and work in relative quiet.

Practice and learn new vocabulary regularly, but only write what comes naturally.

Always read and review what you have written, no matter how good spellcheck is. Imagine turninging in a paper that said ‘cock’ instead of ‘cook’. Spell check, also, doesn’t catch the awkward cadence of a sentence, or the prickle of a wrong word. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/60494059082) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)

Make sure that when you leave something vague, you’ve explored all the options a reader could take from that vagueness. Be deliberate about being vague. It is just as much a tool as explicit narrative. BetterBeMeta has written many a wonderful article on topics of fanfiction and roleplay, of genre and other.

It’s better to give a small bit on the character’s appearance, and sprinkle reminders and new details throughout the piece, than to assault a reader all at once with each of their sun spots and crinkled scars. #(advice) #(description) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/57080037142/) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
Give yourself a restriction or constraint: no using the letter ‘H’; use only words beginning with vowels; write only about characters from the knee down.

Before setting out to write, decide how close your narrator is. Stay consistent in this closeness. Closeness of narrator can be as far away as an omniscient party without opinion or bias in the story, to as close as a stream of consciousness by a character. George R. R. Martin, in a third person limited, works with a close narrator. We see the impact of character view and opinion, but we aren’t always clued into the character’s direct thoughts one hundred percent of the time. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/55975218841) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)

"If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." - Elmore Leonard. Sometimes we overwrite. We over-edit. And it sounds too flowery, or too  polished, odd as the latter might sound. When someone reads, and they’re suddenly struck with the idea that ‘a writer wrote this’, rather than taking it for the story it is, it may be overworked. #(quote) #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/51489489049) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)
"The problem with the skeleton metaphor for plot (and all the other architectural and mechanical models) is that it misrepresents what plot is and how it works. Plot isn’t a wire hanger that you hang the clothes of a story on. Plot is diffusive; it permeates all the atoms of fiction. It can’t be deboned. It isn’t a series of I-beams that keeps everything from collapsing. It is a force that saturates every page, paragraph, and word. Perhaps a better metaphor for plot would be electromagnetism— the force that draws the atoms of the story together. It correlates images, events, and people." - Ronald B.

"The scariest moment is always just before you start." - Stephen King. The hardest part of doing anything is always the beginning of it. When you’re about to start something new, try not to think about it too much. Just open your notebook or a new document on your computer and start typing down what you have in mind. When you have the beginning it’s easier to keep going. #(advice) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com/post/68481665227) @(http://prompts-and-pointers.tumblr.com)

Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 1. "Actually finishing it is what I’m gonna put in as step one. You may laugh at this, but it’s true. I have so many friends who have written two-thirds of a screenplay, and then re-written it for about three years. Finishing a screenplay is first of all truly difficult, and secondly really liberating. Even if it’s not perfect, even if you know you’re gonna have to go back into it, type to the end. You have to have a little closure." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 2. "Structure means knowing where you’re going; making sure you don’t meander about. Some great films have been made by meandering people, like Terrence Malick and Robert Altman, but it’s not as well done today and I don’t recommend it. I’m a structure nut. I actually make charts. Where are the jokes? The thrills? The romance? Who knows what, and when? You need these things to happen at the right times, and that’s what you build your structure around: the way you want your audience to feel. Charts, graphs, coloured pens, anything that means you don’t go in blind is useful." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 3. "Have something to say. This really should be number one. Even if you’re writing a Die Hard rip-off, have something to say about Die Hard rip-offs. The number of movies that are not about what they purport to be about is staggering. It’s rare, especially in genres, to find a movie with an idea and not just, ‘This’ll lead to many fine set-pieces’. The Island evolves into a car-chase movie, and the moments of joy are when they have clone moments and you say, ‘What does it feel like to be those guys?’" #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 4. "Everybody has a reason to live. Everybody has a perspective. Everybody in your scene, including the thug flanking your bad guy, has a reason. They have their own voice, their own identity, their own history. If anyone speaks in such a way that they’re just setting up the next person’s lines, then you don’t get dialogue: you get soundbites. Not everybody has to be funny; not everybody has to be cute; not everybody has to be delightful, and not everybody has to speak, but if you don’t know who everybody is and why they’re there, why they’re feeling what they’re feeling and why they’re doing what they’re doing, then you’re in trouble." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 5. "Here’s one trick that I learned early on. If something isn’t working, if you have a story that you’ve built and it’s blocked and you can’t figure it out, take your favourite scene, or your very best idea or set-piece, and cut it. It’s brutal, but sometimes inevitable. That thing may find its way back in, but cutting it is usually an enormously freeing exercise." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 6. "When I’ve been hired as a script doctor, it’s usually because someone else can’t get it through to the next level. It’s true that writers are replaced when executives don’t know what else to do, and that’s terrible, but the fact of the matter is that for most of the screenplays I’ve worked on, I’ve been needed, whether or not I’ve been allowed to do anything good. Often someone’s just got locked, they’ve ossified, they’re so stuck in their heads that they can’t see the people around them. It’s very important to know when to stick to your guns, but it’s also very important to listen to absolutely everybody. The stupidest person in the room might have the best idea." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 7. "You have one goal: to connect with your audience. Therefore, you must track what your audience is feeling at all times. One of the biggest problems I face when watching other people’s movies is I’ll say, ‘This part confuses me’, or whatever, and they’ll say, ‘What I’m intending to say is this’, and they’ll go on about their intentions. None of this has anything to do with my experience as an audience member. Think in terms of what audiences think. They go to the theatre, and they either notice that their butts are numb, or they don’t. If you’re doing your job right, they don’t. People think of studio test screenings as terrible, and that’s because a lot of studios are pretty stupid about it. They panic and re-shoot, or they go, ‘Gee, Brazil can’t have an unhappy ending,’ and that’s the horror story. But it can make a lot of sense." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 8. "Write the movie as much as you can. If something is lush and extensive, you can describe it glowingly; if something isn’t that important, just get past it tersely. Let the read feel like the movie; it does a lot of the work for you, for the director, and for the executives who go, ‘What will this be like when we put it on its feet?’" #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 9. "Having given the advice about listening, I have to give the opposite advice, because ultimately the best work comes when somebody’s fucked the system; done the unexpected and let their own personal voice into the machine that is moviemaking. Choose your battles. You wouldn’t get Paul Thomas Anderson, or Wes Anderson, or any of these guys if all moviemaking was completely cookie-cutter. But the process drives you in that direction; it’s a homogenising process, and you have to fight that a bit. There was a point while we were making Firefly when I asked the network not to pick it up: they’d started talking about a different show." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)
Joss Whedon’s top 10 writing tips: 10. "The first penny I ever earned, I saved. Then I made sure that I never had to take a job just because I needed to. I still needed jobs of course, but I was able to take ones that I loved. When I say that includes Waterworld, people scratch their heads, but it’s a wonderful idea for a movie. Anything can be good. Even Last Action Hero could’ve been good. There’s an idea somewhere in almost any movie: if you can find something that you love, then you can do it. If you can’t, it doesn’t matter how skilful you are: that’s called whoring." #(quote) #(advice) @(http://aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/13/joss-whedons-top-10-writing-tips/) @(Joss Whedon)

Female characters should be characters first and female second. The fact that they’re women shouldn’t get in the way of their other traits. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Don’t have all your female characters be sexy when the physical appearance of your male characters can vary wildly. Especially egregious in visual media. Keep your ratio of pretty to average at least mostly even across the sexes. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)

While it’s true sometimes women think about their breasts, it’s never with any depth (in my experience).

It makes my face go ಠ_ಠ #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Having “good” female characters be cute and “evil” female characters be sexy is kind of lazy. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)

A woman can be very competent without being a Mary Sue. A woman who can catch on to any skill or masters something very quickly is in danger of falling into the bottomless pit of Sueness. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Making a female character good at stereotypical “boy things” is, if you’ll pardon my french, a bullshit way to characterize. It’s distressingly common in TV shows that think they’re clever and subversive. The best way to handle female auto mechanics or professional ass-kickers or whatever is to give a reason for her to have that skill (like any other skill, you know, don’t make her an awesome musician for no reason) and to not make a big deal about it, in-universe or out. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
A female viewpoint character describing herself in poetic terms (“chocolate eyes”) is going to come across as self-aggrandizing.

A lot of women won’t give very deep regard to other women’s bodies. They’ll probably notice bad skin or frumpy outfits, but beyond that they won’t scrutinize too hard.

Particularly shallow women will give very deep regard to other women’s bodies.

Not all women desire marriage and children. Some want one or the other, some want neither. Not all women want to be testicle-crushing CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, either. Some want to be psychiatrists or artists or teachers or morticians…or whatever else. You know, just like men. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Female characters should probably not be solely motivated by a need to have the approval or attention of a man. Or all men in general, really. Female characters who do this ought to change by the end of the story, and realize that their happiness shouldn’t depend on the whims of menfolk. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Actions speak louder than words. Even if you don’t state it directly, a female character who appears motivated only by men is going to be assumed to be motivated only by men. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Empowering a female character doesn’t mean she’s terrible to men just for being men—it just means she’s not stepped on for being a woman. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Avoid that one female archetype who is rude and often violent to her spineless male love interest, but they end up together in the end anyway. If the genders were reversed, it would be called an abusive relationship—and even then, there will be some segment of your readers who finds it romantic. Yes, Twilight, I’m looking at you. Glaring. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
The “headstrong” female character who has wacky banter with the similarly headstrong male lead leads me to believe they’d have really excellent (if angry) sex, but probably wouldn’t last in a normal relationship for longer than a couple days unless one or the other grows out of their headstrongness. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
In a romance story, or a story containing elements of romance, please don’t give the female lead stupid reasons for liking the hero. Reasons like “he’s well-endowed” or “she knows his inner depths, despite his blatant jerkoff behavior on display literally all the time.” I’m kind of sick of the hero always getting the girl anyway, like she’s prize at the end of the race—but if you insist on keeping that plot element, at least give both of them good qualities. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
Don’t have a female character for the sake of having a female character, which is something I see happen in video games and comics a lot. Give her something to do that isn’t doting on the hero. #(advice) @(http://impishidea.com/writing/how-not-to-write-female-characters)
