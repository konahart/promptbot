- ircPromptBot.py -> promptbot.py
- command parsing completely restructured - now has dictionary of commands
- added "info," "tag counts," and "list length" commands
- now also listens to "!" prefix the same as "promptbot, " (will be make configurable later
- "start topic" and "stop topic" commands no longer give response to user (to be fixed) but presumably still work the same

- last list logic moved from listbot to ircPromptBot
- listbot -> listkeeper

13 December 2013
- start and stop looping topics in multiple channels
- argparsing now allows for more setup before joining channels, init file
- now handles ssl
- new lists cannot be created with an existing list name nor name+s, e.g., cannot have "prompt" and "prompts" lists
- automatically adds user adding prompt as a source for the prompt ("added by $USER")
- selectTopic made separate for easier customization
